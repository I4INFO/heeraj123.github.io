<p>The Hack the Vote CTF was fun, it was made as the theme of US election. I managed to Solve one Crypto50 and Web 200 Challenge.
I will discussing today on web200 challenge. This was a combo attack, with Remote file inclusion and SQL Injection.</p>

<p>I was fussing through the website, I found there was directory traversal.</p>
