<p>This was something unusual , when I saw it I thought by seeing it would be an injection , tried all the stuff. Didn't work , and was waiting for the writeup in ctftime.</p>

<p>When the writeup came it was intresting , it was some crlf , which means " Carriage Return and Line Feed ". That is something new for me , and something to learn. When I googled I found that is something which is simple and but has affectd in many pages in google adsense .</p>

<p>\n means line feed and \r means carrige return. %0d is carriage return and %0a is line feed. And here the problem is about memcache it is distributed memory caching system. The main aim is to obtain the flag , for that we look for memcache commands.</p>
