<p>This is my first post in our I4INFO website. If you like to read our old blogs you are welcome, <a href="javascript:alert(1)">I4INFO</a> Want to be a member of our team, contact us!</p>

<p>It was an start for the ctf , the first problem which I looked upon, by seeing the login page!the first thing that came in my mind is sql injection.</p>

<p>Sql injection the art of breaking sql code and execute our sql code , or make to make the authentication bypass.</p>

<blockquote>The query that comes to the mind is "'or 1=1" , as usual tried and got the login bypass by using, <br> admin ' or 1=1#</blockquote>

<p>The message I got was ,</p>

<blockquote>Congratulation<br>Flag is your password</blockquote>

<p>This is the hint for the problem, flag has been stored in the database!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Let the hack begin!</h2>

<p>By trying the several query based on mysql we got to understand! Its not a mysql database. Its a sqlite3 database.</p>

<p>Problem solved , by 2 query execution we got the flag, the first query to get the table name.</p>

<blockquote><br>admin' union select password,password from user where user="admin"</blockquote>
