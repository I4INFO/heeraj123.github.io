<p>Hack lu CTF web challenges easy compared to the other CTF, well then basically the bashful, was the easiest of them.</p>

<p>The source code was provided, I started to analyse the source . I could not find anything. I was pretty new to bash type of website. I thought reading about them more. I found something very intresting.</p>

<p>The easiest way to test a web server via HTTP request is to inject the bash command through the user agent. Refer for <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/68139/attack-scenarios-of-the-new-bash-vulnerability">info</a>.</p>
